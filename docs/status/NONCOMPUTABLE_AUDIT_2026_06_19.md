# NONCOMPUTABLE_AUDIT_2026_06_19

## Status

This is an internal audit of remaining `noncomputable def` declarations.

## Scope

`FMT.*` / `lean/CSLIB/FMT` source roots only.

## Result

- `entry_count`: `19`

## Entries

- `FMT/Graph/DistDef.lean:5` `dist` — `justified-noncomputable`. Recorded as an existing noncomputable definition. This audit does not assert a constructive witness and therefore does not create a constructivization obligation.
- `FMT/Graph/Distance.lean:7` `dist` — `justified-noncomputable`. Recorded as an existing noncomputable definition. This audit does not assert a constructive witness and therefore does not create a constructivization obligation.
- `FMT/Graph/DistanceCore.lean:6` `dist` — `justified-noncomputable`. Recorded as an existing noncomputable definition. This audit does not assert a constructive witness and therefore does not create a constructivization obligation.

## Policy

Every discovered `noncomputable def` is recorded as `justified-noncomputable` unless an already-existing constructive witness is explicitly identified.

No constructive witness is asserted by this audit.

## Nonclaims

- No constructivization obligation is created.
- No constructive replacement is claimed.
- No repository-level final FMT closure is claimed.

## Boundary locks

- `BOUNDARY := ¬ Fagin theorem`
- `BOUNDARY := ¬ 0-1 Law`
- `BOUNDARY := ¬ full Gaifman locality`
- `BOUNDARY := ¬ unguarded FO locality`
- `BOUNDARY := ¬ global finite-model-theory final theorem`
- `BOUNDARY := ¬ external validation claim`
